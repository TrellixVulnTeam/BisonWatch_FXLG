# Beschreibung
Beschreibung :3 S: In order to help 3rd Semester Master Media Architecture / Architecture students become better prepared for their upcoming thesis semester, this module is designed to facilitate students to become aware of what is to be expected before and during their thesis projects, particularly when it comes to critical and theoretical writing. During this online course students shall understand what the overall criteria is required within a contextual thesis and shall learn to develop and finalize an extended thesis proposal, that is able to indicate the important analysis of their given work / subject matter in question. It is where master-students shall importantly learn how to expand contexts attached to their interested thesis perspectives, into given subjects that can be fundamentally narrowed into a particular set of researched topics and achieve an overall connecting narrative. In these online lectures, and workshops students will be able to openly develop their given arguments and arrangement of counter-arguments, while learning to maintain a decent level of primary and secondary research, as well as forming important questions and concerns that could become attached to their final thesis. In addition, students shall be taught the goal of keeping a high level of narrative-telling and tension building, when it comes to writing theoretically, as well as knowing the importance of structural flow of introduction, body of work and conclusions. While maintaining the fundamental approaches that are needed when the students shall enter their final thesis semester, including: , <em>quality of evidence attached to the student’s argument: placing such supporting material for and against the argument, and what is the claim for making such an overall argument of importance.</em>
